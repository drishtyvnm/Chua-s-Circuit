# Chua-s-Circuit
The *Chua circuit* is a simple electronic circuit that exhibits chaotic behavior, making it a classic example in the study of nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory. It was first introduced by *Leon O. Chua* in 1983. The circuit is composed of basic electronic components such as resistors, capacitors, an inductor, and a nonlinear element called the Chua diode.
